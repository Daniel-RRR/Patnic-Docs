# Introduction
The Size of this Project may be a little daunting at first glance.  
Thats why we strongly recommend our VS-Code Setup as a starting point for further Personalication.  



# Comment-anchors

###### Explorer
Comment anchors are very Usefull for Finding marked Files ver Fast. there are three Types of Marker:  
1. **Doc-Links** can open you the Documentation in HTML or Markdown Format and are at the very Top of Files. 
2. **epic Bookmarks** open the File they are in, you can find a categoriced list of them by clicking the Anchor on the Sidebar.
3. **contextual Todos** are used as temporarilly Bookmarked Changes and Errors. you can use ``# BUG``,``# STUB``, ``# REFACTOR`` and ``# REVIEW`` 


###### Files
Bookmarks can also be used to improve Navigation in a File itself. For a Good example, take a look on the Entity-class, you can find it by its Bookmark ;)  
Typical uses are:
  
1. for grouping similar functions use:  
``# ----- EXAMPLE ---------------------------------------------------------------- ##``  
2. for grouping lines in a big or not atomiced function into their stages use  
`` #>>> Name Of Stage <<<#`` 
3. for additional info while mousehovering a functioncall, write above  
``# FUNC > important info I.E about parameter``  
4. for additional info about a Variable, write above  
``# VAR > important info I.E valid Keys of a Dictionary``
